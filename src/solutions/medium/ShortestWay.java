 * Leet 1055. Shortest Way to Form String
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-way-to-form-string/description/?envType=weekly-question&envId=2025-03-29
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without
 * disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 * Given two strings source and target, return the minimum number of subsequences of source such that their concatenation equals target. If the task is impossible, return -1.
